Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. However, the first case may be traced back to 17 November, 2019. As of 28 May 2020, more than 5.8 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 359,000 deaths. More than 2.39 million people have recovered. With the advent of this new killer disease, governments and international organisations and bodies have decided to take certain preventive measures to limit the widespread of the this virus, notably though worldwide confinements and providing certain basic necessities to populations in order to assist them in these tough times.
